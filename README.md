# Crypto Coding Club

We are a programming club for Alumni (and friends) from [Enspiral Dev Academy](http://www.devacademy.co.nz) focusing on blockchain applications. 

Any projects loosely related to the blockchain are welcome, whether you want to build smart contracts, web UIs or crypto trading bots. Hey, if you want to build your own blockchain from scratch then come and say hi.

There are no teachers or students here, just programmers wanting to mess around with a fun technology. You should learn a lot and hopefully build some portfolio apps that you are proud of, you might even be able to land work in the crypto space if that's something you want. 

## FAQ

### Why Crypto?

1. Node and React are useful technologies in the crypto ecosystem. You can interact directly with the Ethereum blockchain using libraries like [web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) and most people interact with blockchains through web interfaces so tools like react are super useful.
2. You can also do a lot with APIs - want to build a trading algorithm that buys and sells bitcoin while you sleep? You can do it all through REST and websocket APIs. 
3. A lot of crypto companies are remote friendly, so if you can get some experience in the space then the world is your oyster in terms of job prospects.
4. A lot of crypto teams have community funds, so even without landing a job you can get paid to build things that are useful for crypto communities on a project basis.

### Do I need to know anything about blockchains or crypto to join?

Not at all. Whether you are completely new to the space or have been exploring the crypto rabbit hole for years, you are welcome to join.

### How much time do I need to commit?

It's completely up to you, there are no time requirements to be part of the club.

### Is there a curriculum?

Nope. We will crowdsource some useful learning resources but it will be very much a self directed learning environment.

### Is this a place to talk about investment and trading so I can make lots of money?

No, there are plenty of other places to do that and this club is all about practicing programming in the context of crypto and blockchains. 

### What does it cost?

1 Bitcoin per person.

Nah, not really. You pay by showing up and helping others in their learning journey. Everyone will be asked to re-up their membership when we open the club to new members.

### When can I join?

We align with EDA bootcamps - new club members are welcome to join in the two weeks after graduation. If you miss that window then you will need to wait until the next one.

### Are there formal meetings?

Three formal meetings per cohort on Thursday evenings at 7pm.
- Week 2 - orientation and welcome new members
- Week 5 - project presentations
- Week 10 / 0 - project presentations

### How do I join?

Easy, hit up JV in the EDA slack / discord and send him your github username.
