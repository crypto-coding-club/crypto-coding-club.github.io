# Crypto Coding Club

We are a programming club for Alumni (and friends) from [Enspiral Dev Academy](http://www.devacademy.co.nz) focusing on blockchain applications. 

Any projects loosely related to the blockchain is welcome, whether you want to build smart contracts, web UIs or crypto trading bots. Hey, if you want to build your own blockchain from scratch then come and say hi.

There are no teachers or students here, just programmers wanting to mess around with a fun technology.

If you're keen, hit up JV for a link to the discord server in slack.
