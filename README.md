# Crypto Coding Club

We are a programming club for Alumni (and friends) from [Enspiral Dev Academy](http://www.devacademy.co.nz) focusing on blockchain applications. 

Any projects loosely related to the blockchain are welcome, whether you want to build smart contracts, web UIs or crypto trading bots. Hey, if you want to build your own blockchain from scratch then come and say hi.

There are no teachers or students here, just programmers wanting to mess around with a fun technology. You should learn a lot and hopefully build some portfolio apps that you are proud of, you might even be able to land work in the crypto space if that's something you want. 

## FAQ

### Why Crypto?

1. Node and React are useful technologies in the crypto ecosystem. You can interact directly with the Ethereum blockchain using libraries like [web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) and most people interact with blockchains through web interfaces.
2. You can do a lot with APIs - want to build a trading algorithm that trades bitcoin while you sleep? You can do it all through REST and websocket APIs. ([Quantative Trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-trading.asp) is a whole discipline which you could dive in to if that's your jam).
3. A lot of crypto companies are remote friendly, so if you can get some experience in the space then the world is your oyster in terms of job prospects.
4. A lot of crypto teams have community funds, so even without landing a job you can get paid to build things that are useful for crypto communities on a project basis.

### Is there a curriculum?

Nope. We will crowdsource some useful learning resources but it will be very much a self directed learning environments.

### When can I join?

We align with EDA bootcamps - new club members are welcome to join in the two week window after graduation (Week 0 and 1 of each cohort starting bootcamp). If you miss that window then you will need to wait 8 weeks until the next one.

### How do I join?

Easy, hit up JV in the EDA slack and send him your github username.
